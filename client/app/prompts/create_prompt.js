//The createPromptController is responsible for creating the intitial "prompt" or "round" that is voted on.
//Note: 'prompt' and "round" are synonymous.  When we began the project we started calling one play of the game a prompt since the author supplied one
//to start off the game a sugestion.  We switched to round later since it makes it seem more like a game.
//The user gives the prompt a title.  Once the prompt is created users have 4 hours to upload a photo for the prompt after which no more photos can be uploaded for
//that prompt.  Users upload each photo anomously and the author has 6 hours after the creation of the prompt to choose a winner.
